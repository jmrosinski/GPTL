o Get Intel to use -qopenmp. For now -fopenmp works but for how long?
o Test with PGI
+ Test with clang/gfortran
  - Gave up on enabling OMP
+ Change default to unwind
  + Check for libunwind rather than header file
o Get versioning right for: Currently follows same rules as netcdf
  o Version in gptl.pc
  o Naming of .so files
o How to handle CMake
  - Mark O. help given output from gptl.pc
  - Or, create CMake info from configure
o Test with memusage stats
x Get rid of warnings from "autoreconf -i" about serial number
+ Parallel make work OK?
+ Libs vs Libs.private
+ Requires vs Requires.private
+ Does -fopenmp belong instead in Cflags and Fflags?
+ Have "make clean" always get rid of all generated files
+ Does gptl.pc need "-finstrument-functions"? I've added it for now
