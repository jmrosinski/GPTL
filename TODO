x Get Intel to use -qopenmp. For now -fopenmp works but for how long?
+ Test with PGI
  - Requires CPP="pgcc -E" or fails CPP check
+ Test with clang/gfortran
  + Gave up on enabling OMP
+ Change default to unwind
  + Check for libunwind rather than header file
o Get versioning right for: Currently follows same rules as netcdf
  o Version in gptl.pc
  + Naming of .so files (docs say start with 0.0.0)
o How to handle CMake
  - Mark O. help given output from gptl.pc
  - Or, create CMake info from configure
+ Test with memusage stats
x Get rid of warnings from "autoreconf -i" about serial number
+ Parallel make work OK?
+ Libs vs Libs.private
+ Requires vs Requires.private
+ Does -fopenmp belong instead in Cflags and Fflags?
+ Have "make clean" always get rid of all generated files
+ Does gptl.pc need "-finstrument-functions"? It's OFF for now
+ Check PAPI with built-in tests
+ Test with big UFO app
o Travis passing
o Test with GSI on hera
+ Test with pthreads
o Make pthreads more efficient (ordered list of pthread_ids)
+ Add ability to inline thread*.c
+ Test with Intel
+ Fix clang warnings
+ Ensure "make check" does the right thing when lib has been rebuilt
+ Is there a working "make uninstall" in GPTL?
o Correct printout from building
