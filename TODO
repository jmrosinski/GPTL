o Enable MPI to work for CPU codes even though GPTL's CUDA implementation doesn't handle it.
o Enable CUDA implementation to summarize MPI results
o Build all the codes in facctests
o Compile Fortran lib routines into libgptl.a, as is now done for GPU
o Why is "scalefac" such a big number when disabling GPU checks?
