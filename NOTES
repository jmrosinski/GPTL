% switchgcc.sh (set to gcc8 because nvcc can't handle 9 or 10)
% module load nvidia/20.7
Need --disable-shared when building with nvidia--CUDA fails with shared, maybe CPU as well?
Need CFLAGS="" because brain-dead nvcc barfs on multiple "-O" settings, and configure initializes
Need --disable-inline-threading because the #include demands .c files not .cu--probably easy fix
  CFLAGS to -O2
% env CC=nvcc FC=nvfortran CFLAGS="" ./configure --cache-file=/dev/null --disable-shared --enable-cuda --disable-inline-threading

Current status: Both tests in cuda/tests succeed
Test W/O nvidia module loaded:
  % ./configure
  % make clean; make; make check
  Succeeds
