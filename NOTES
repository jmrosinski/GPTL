switchgcc.sh (set to gcc8 because nvcc can't handle 9 or 10)
module load nvidia/20.7
Need --disable-shared when building with nvidia for some reason
./configure --disable-shared --enable-cuda --enable-facc

Current status: Link fails in first exe creation in cuda/tests
Linking with nvc instead of nvcc seems to help but fails with unsat. externals.
