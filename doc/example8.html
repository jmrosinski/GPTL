<h2>Example 8: Printing max memory usage (RSS) during an application</h2>
Here is shown the output from running a simple test code (GPTL/tests/memusage.c), where
the appropriate GPTL calls have been made to print when the memory resident set size (RSS) of
the process has grown whenever calling <b>GPTLstart()</b> or <b>GPTLstop()</b>. In this simple
example the size of the process is made to grow by calling <b>realloc</b> a number of times
for some number of MB. Note that RSS would not necessarily grow, were it not for touching the 
reallocated memory by calling <b>memset</b>.

<p>
<b><em>memusage.c:</em></b>
<pre>
<div style="background-color:white;">
#include &#60gptl.h&gt
#include &#60stdio.h&gt
#include &#60string.h&gt

const int onemb = 1024 * 1024;
void sub (unsigned char *, int);

int main ()
{
  int ret;
  int n;
  unsigned char *arr;

  // Print when process size has grown.
  if ((ret = GPTLsetoption (GPTLdopr_memusage, 1)) != 0)
    return -1;
  
  // Only print when the process has grown by 50% or more since the last print
  // (or since the process started)
  if ((ret = GPTLsetoption (GPTLmem_growth, 50)) != 0)
    return -1;
  
  ret = GPTLinitialize ();
  for (n = 1; n < 10; ++n)
    sub (arr, n);
  return 0;
}

void sub (unsigned char *arr, int n)
{
  unsigned char *space;
  int ret;

  ret = GPTLstart ("sub");
  space = (unsigned char *) realloc (arr, n*onemb*(sizeof (unsigned char)));
  arr = space;
  memset (arr, 0, n*onemb*(sizeof (unsigned char)));
  ret = GPTLstop ("sub");
}
   
</div>
</pre>
Now compile and run:
<pre>
<div>
% cc -o memusage memusage.c -I${GPTL}/include -L${GPTL}/lib -lgptl
% ./memusage
</div>
</pre>

Here's the important output:
<pre>
<div style="background-color:white;">
Begin sub RSS grew to     3.35 MB
End sub RSS grew to     5.14 MB
End sub RSS grew to     8.23 MB
End sub RSS grew to    17.26 MB
End sub RSS grew to    30.15 MB
End sub RSS grew to    47.16 MB
</div>
</pre>
<h3>Explanation of the above output</h3>
Even though "sub" was called 10 times, only 6 prints of RSS growth occurred. This is because
the second call to <b>GPTLsetoption()</b> said to only report when growth from the previous
print was by at least 50%. This approach can limit sometimes annoying large volumes of printout
when only a tiny increase in RSS occurs.
