This file describes how to build and install GPTL. For information on using
the library, see the web pages in the doc/ directory, the file README in the
main directory, and the provided man pages.

The build procedure is basic autoconf:

% ./configure; make; make check; make install.

Generally you'll want to specify C and Fortran compilers with
environment variables. To enable MPI support, use the wrappers, e.g.

% env CC=mpicc FC=mpif90 ./configure --prefix=</some/installation/directory>

The "configure" script automatically tests for MPI functionality and includes
it if it proves functional. "configure" also automatically tests for OpenMP
functionality (unless --disable-openmp is specified), and includes support if
OpenMP tests succeed.

Other switches to "configure" you may want to consider enabling include:

--enable-pmpi: Enables MPI auto-profiling with the PMPI layer provided by most
MPi distros

--enable-papi: Enables PAPI (Performance API) support for hardware performance
counters (https://icl.utk.edu/papi/). The PAPI lib must be installed in a
standard location in order for this option to work.

--enable-nestedomp: Enables support for OpenMP apps utilizing nested OMP
constructs. Use this only if you really need it. It adds significant overhead.

There are other options (see ./configure --help), but these are the main ones
folks generally use.

The "make install" step installs the built library, documentation including
man pages, and also gptl.pc for optional use by applications which can make
use of pkg-config.
